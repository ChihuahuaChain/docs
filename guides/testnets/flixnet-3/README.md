# FlixNet-3
FlixNet-3 for OmniFlix is all about testing the oNFT standard, the marketplace, the UI/UX and usability of the applications (Studio & Market) while interfacing with the node hosts and developers that eventually build applications on top of the OmniFlix Network.

From an IBC standpoint, FlixNet-3 is currently connected to the StreamPay Testnet and the Juno (uni) testnet.

# Details of Participation

Current participation of Validators in FlixNet-3 will be limited to a current active set of 50 and with proposals (that have 1 day voting time), we aim to increase the active set.

**We advise node hosts NOT to run nodes until the application & review process is completed. Until then, no tokens to run a validator node will be provided. The Google Form for validators to apply will be released on 22nd December 2021.**

Since the code is open source, you can feel free to run a full node if you're developing a centralized or a decentralized application on top of the network.
